Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è
Backend
Node.js, Express.js for API routing

MongoDB with Mongoose for flexible and schema-less data

Socket.IO for real-time bidirectional communication

JWT for secure, stateless authentication

Frontend
React with React Router for UI and routing

@dnd-kit for accessible, performant drag-and-drop

Tailwind CSS for rapid, responsive styling

react-toastify for notifications

Socket.IO-client for real-time syncing

Why these technologies?
Node.js enables a full-stack JavaScript environment. MongoDB‚Äôs schema flexibility suits dynamic data. Socket.IO ensures instant updates for collaborative editing. React‚Äôs component-based architecture easily manages complex UIs. Tailwind speeds up styling while maintaining responsiveness.

Get Started üöÄ
Prerequisites
Node.js v18+

MongoDB (local or Atlas cluster)

Git

Setup Instructions
Clone the repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/trello-clone.git
cd trello-clone
Configure environment variables

Copy .env.example to .env in the root directory

Update variables (MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET, etc.)

Install dependencies (NPM workspaces)

bash
npm install
Start the backend server

bash
cd backend
npm start
The backend runs on http://localhost:5001 with Socket.IO for real-time events.

Start the frontend application

bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
Access the app at http://localhost:5173 (default Vite port).

Design Documentation
High-Level Design (HLD)
Frontend (React) communicates with Express backend via REST and Socket.IO.

Backend manages API routing, DB operations, and real-time events.

Authentication secured via JWT tokens.

Data stored in MongoDB collections representing users, workspaces, boards, cards, and logs.

Real-time features use WebSocket via Socket.IO for collaboration.

Low-Level Design (LLD)
API Endpoints for authentication, workspace, board, and card management.

JSON error model with consistent response format.

MongoDB indexing on foreign keys and position fields for performance.
